## Project Overview

This project is a browser-based Super Mario-inspired game that brings the nostalgic charm of the 90s and early 2k gaming era to life. It features an interactive and attractive UI with animations, sound, and classic gameplay elements. The game includes:

- **Loading Screen**: A dynamic loading animation while the game is preparing.
- **Main Menu**: Interactive buttons for starting a new game, accessing settings, and exiting the game.
- **Background Music**: An embedded background music from YouTube for a more immersive experience.
- **Mobile-Responsive**: The UI is designed to work seamlessly across all devices, providing a smooth experience for mobile and desktop users.

## Features

- **Modern UI** with vibrant colors and a classic feel.
- **Loading Animation** with a retro-style gif.
- **Start Game, Settings, and Exit Options**.
- **Embedded background music** with autoplay.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade-in effect for the menu and interactive animations for buttons.
- **Game Loop**: The core of the game, which handles updates and rendering.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
- No server setup needed for local play

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/super-mario-na-summa-va.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd super-mario-na-summa-va
    ```
3. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser**:
    - Simply double-click on `index.html` to open it in a browser.

The game should load automatically with the retro loading screen and offer a start button to begin the adventure!

## Usage

Once the page is loaded:

- **Click "Start Game"** to begin the game and dive into the Mario-inspired world.
- **Click "Settings"** to access settings (currently a placeholder).
- **Click "Exit"** to exit the game. The page will attempt to close the window or redirect to a goodbye page.

You can also press **Enter** on your keyboard to start the game immediately.

## Game Controls

Currently, the game supports:

- **Arrow keys** to move the player (this feature is implemented within the game logic).
- **Spacebar** to jump (again, this functionality will be part of the ongoing game development).

As development progresses, more controls and features will be added.
